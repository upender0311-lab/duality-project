# ðŸ”¥ Duality Hackathon Project

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
This project was developed as part of the *Duality Hackathon*.  
The goal is to build and evaluate an object detection model that achieves high accuracy on the given dataset.

---

## ðŸš€ Approach
- Model used: *YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 / [your model name]*
- Training data: Provided dataset from the hackathon
- Key steps:
  1. Data preprocessing and augmentation
  2. Model training with hyperparameter tuning
  3. Evaluation using *mAP50* and other metrics
  4. Testing on unseen images

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- *Highest mAP50 Achieved:* XX%  
- *Other Metrics:*  
  - Precision: XX%  
  - Recall: XX%  

ðŸ“Œ Sample detection results:
